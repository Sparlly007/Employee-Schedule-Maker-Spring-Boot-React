# Scheduling-Project-Spring-Boot-React
This project is meant for businesses to manage schedules among their employees and enable better communication between employees and managers regarding schedule adjustments and submitting requests for days off.  

# Tech Used:
Spring Boot, React.js, Postgresql, Visual Studio Code

# Backend: Spring Boot
The backend of the application was developed with Java Spring Boot, which was used to set up the microservices and RESTful APIs that involve JWT user authentication, user creation, and functionalities for users to set up custom groups and schedules.  Object-relational mapping (ORM) with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate eased the process of creating database tables for each of the application's data entities. 

# Frontend: React.js
The frontend of the application was developed with React.js which contains the endpoints that communicate with the backend's REST APIs to enable and store user input.  This involved user authentication and visual listings of groups per user, users per group, and users' schedules and days off per group. 

# What did I learn?
As someone with little software engineering experience outside of academics, this project was a meaningful introduction for me to learn more about what goes into full-stack applications and how frontend and backend components interact with each other.  I was glad to learn more about Spring Boot, its functionalities in ORM and RESTful APIs, and how Java operates in backend development in general as someone with proficiency in the language.  The same goes for React.js and learning how to display and hide information in an efficient manner.  

I've also learned how essential online research is in order to learn new technologies and solve problems, as it helped me solve complex problems that involved setting CORS configuration to enable communication between frontend and backend and being up to date with current versions of frameworks to see what is and isn't deprecated.
