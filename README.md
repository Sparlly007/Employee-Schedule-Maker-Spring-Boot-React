# Scheduling-Project-Spring-Boot-React
This project is meant for businesses to manage schedules among their employees and enable better communication between employees and managers regarding schedule adjustments and submitting requests for days off.  

# Tech Used:
Spring Boot, React, Postgresql, Visual Studio Code

# Backend: Spring Boot
Backend of the application was developed with Java Spring Boot, which was used to set up the microservices and RESTful APIs that involve user authentication, user creation, and functionalities for users to set up custom groups and schedules.  Spring Data JPA's object-relational mapping eased the process of creating database tables for each of the application's data entities.
